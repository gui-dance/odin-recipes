    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>My dad used to make huge Thanksgiving dinners, and the morning after, we would be treated to delicious turkey congee. Congee is a Chinese rice porridge traditionally eaten for breakfast or brunch, but I personally eat it any time. It is also very good for digestion and has excellent health benefits. Although I've been having congee since I was a baby, it remains for me the ultimate comfort food.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup dried scallops</li>
        <li>3 dried black mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>4½ leftover turkey carcass, broken into pieces</li>
        <li>9 cups water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place dried scallops and dried mushrooms in a bowl; pour in hot water to cover and let stand to rehydrate, about 10 minutes. Rinse and drain rice; set aside.</li>
        <li>Separate any meat from bones of turkey carcass; set aside. Place bones and 9 cups hot water in a large stockpot and bring to a boil. Drain mushrooms and scallops; squeeze out any excess water. Break scallops into smaller pieces; slice mushrooms thinly.</li>
        <li>Stir scallops, mushrooms, rice, and turkey meat into the stockpot; reduce heat to allow congee to simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally for a smooth congee, until rice is tender and congee is thick, about 2 hours. If you like a thinner congee, stir in hot water a few tablespoons at a time.</li>
        <li>Ladle congee into individual bowls; top each bowl with cilantro, green onions, ginger, peanuts, red onion, sesame oil, and white pepper as desired.</li>
    </ol>
